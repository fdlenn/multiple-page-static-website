    <h1>🥐 About Croissants 🥐</h1>

    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by
      the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape,
      the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating.

      The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but using brioche dough.
      Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and
      pâtisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century
      when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a
      yeast-leavened laminated dough.
